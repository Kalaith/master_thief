I've created Master Thief: Heist Planner, a comprehensive web-based heist game that incorporates all the elements you requested. The game features a complete team recruitment system, strategic heist planning, and an encounter-based execution phase with dice rolling mechanics.

Key Features
Team Recruitment System: Choose from six unique specialists including Shadow (infiltration expert), Cipher (tech specialist), Viper (social engineer), Wrench (demolitions expert), Silk (cat burglar), and Ghost (information broker). Each has distinct skill ratings (1-10) across stealth, athletics, combat, lockpicking, hacking, and social abilities.

Strategic Heist Planning: Select from multiple targets including a bank, art museum, and corporate headquarters, each with different difficulty levels, potential payouts, and unique encounter challenges.

Dice Rolling System: The game uses a d20 + skill modifier system with five distinct outcome levels:

Critical Failure (1-4): Major setbacks, team members captured, alarms triggered

Failure (5-9): Minor complications, increased difficulty, suspicious activity

Neutral (10-14): Partial success with unexpected complications

Success (15-18): Clean execution according to plan

Critical Success (19-20): Exceptional performance with bonus discoveries

Encounter Variety: Navigate through security cameras, vault doors, laser grids, guard patrols, and social situations, each requiring different skills and strategic team member selection.

The game emphasizes meaningful choice-making, where selecting the right team member for each encounter based on their skills directly impacts your success chances. Failed rolls create compelling consequences rather than simple dead ends, maintaining tension throughout each heist.
